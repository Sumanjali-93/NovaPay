A **high-performance fintech payment infrastructure** designed to enable **secure, real-time money transfers** between users.  
The system focuses on **scalability, reliability, and financial data integrity**, following modern backend engineering and distributed system design practices.


## Overview

The Instant Payment System is a backend-focused financial platform that simulates the architecture of modern digital payment systems used by fintech companies. It allows users to securely transfer funds, manage digital wallets, track transaction history, and receive real-time notifications.

The platform is built with a modular backend architecture where each core capability—authentication, wallet management, payments, transaction ledger, and notifications—is organized into independent modules. This design improves maintainability, scalability, and separation of concerns.

To ensure performance and reliability, the system integrates database persistence, caching, secure authentication mechanisms, and infrastructure tooling commonly used in production fintech environments.

The system demonstrates how real-world payment platforms handle financial transactions, data consistency, security, and operational monitoring.

# 🎯 Key Objectives

- ⚡ Enable **real-time digital money transfers**
- 🔐 Maintain **secure financial transactions**
- 📊 Track **complete transaction history**
- 💰 Support **wallet balance management**
- 🔔 Deliver **real-time transaction notifications**
- 📈 Provide **administrative analytics and reporting**

## System Architecture

  The digital payment platform follows a monolithic backend architecture where all core modules operate within a single deployable service. This design simplifies           development and ensures strong transactional consistency for financial operations.

  The backend handles authentication, wallet management, payment processing, ledger recording, and notification services while maintaining data integrity and        security.
